## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware, a growing consumer electronics company, encountered significant losses in Latin America due to reliance on surveys and intuition for expansion decisions. Their Excel-based analytics system proved inadequate for handling the increasing volume of data, resulting in poor decision-making. To stay competitive and enable better strategic decisions, AtliQ Hardware decided to embrace data analytics and replace Excel with more advanced tools.
This project is part of the Get Job Ready: Power BI Data Analytics for All Levels 3.0 course cum certification program from Codebasics, where I gained hands-on experience with Power BI and data analytics concepts. It aims to provide actionable insights for stakeholders across various dimensions, including finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive decision-making.
### Objectives 
AtliQ wants to make data-driven decision-making a part of their work culture and is taking their first big step towards that by embedding a Power BI tool in the organization. The key objectives of this project are:
- Implement data analytics and provide actionable insights.
- Use Power BI to enable data-driven decision-making across AtliQ's operations.
- Enable quick insights for business across markets to drive strategic decisions.

  - **gross_price**: Contains data about the gross price of each product in each fiscal year.
  
  - **manufacturing_cost**: Contains data about the manufacturing cost of each product in each fiscal year.
  
  - **post_invoice_deductions**: Contains data about discounts and other deductions in percentage.
  
  - **pre_invoice_deductions**: Contains pre-invoice deduction percentages for each customer in each fiscal year.
- **Other data sources:**  
  - **Excel file**: Extracted market share data, operational expenses and targets data.
  - **Operating-expenses-table-1.xlsx** : contains data about different operating expenses for markets in different fiscal years( such as ads/promotions and some other operational expenses in percentage)
  - **marketshare-v2022.xlsx**: contains market share data for AtliQ and its competitors for different category of products in different sub zones and fiscal year
  - **Targets.xlsx** : contains monthly Net Sales, Gross Margin and Net Profit targets for different markets. 

  **Note:** The fiscal year for AtliQ begins in September.
### Data Model
The data model for this Power BI project follows a **Hybrid Schema** that combines elements of both **Star** and **Snowflake** schemas. The core of the model is structured in a **Star Schema** for simplicity and efficient querying, while some of the dimension tables are further normalized in a **Snowflake Schema** to maintain data integrity and reduce redundancy.

Below is the visual representation of the data model in Power BI:

### Data Transformation

In this section, I outline the key data transformation techniques I learnt and applied throughout the project. The transformations were crucial for cleaning, structuring, and enriching the data to enable actionable insights through Power BI.

#### Techniques learnt:
- **DAX Measures**: 
  - Created various DAX measures to calculate key business metrics, such as Net Sales, Gross Margin, Net Profit and other P & L values.
  
- **Calculated Columns**: 
  - Used DAX to create calculated columns, like gross_sales_amount,net_sales_amount etc to enhance the data model and support detailed analysis.
  
- **Creating Tables**:
  - Used DAX and PowerQuery to create new tables such as fiscal_year, dim_date table.
  
- **Merging and Appending Data**:
  - Merged and appended tables to consolidate information for analysis.
  
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Performed basic data cleaning tasks such as correcting data types, removing trailing spaces, and standardizing spellings.
  

- **Pivoting and Unpivoting Data**:
  - Unpivoted columns of market share data in Power Query to calculate sales amount for each manufacturer

### Visualizations

The following dashboards were created in the final Power BI report to present insights clearly and effectively:

- **Home Page**: A landing page that provides a brief introduction to all the other pages. Users can click on buttons to navigate to each corresponding visual.

- Learned how to create **interactive dashboards** that provide stakeholders with actionable insights.
- Improved skills in transforming raw data into meaningful metrics using **measures** and **calculated columns**.
- Mastered data transformation and cleansing techniques like **data type conversion**, **text manipulation**, and **removal of white spaces**.
### Conclusion
